## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @adobe/helix-auth-fastly
```

## Usage

### As a wrapper

`helix-auth-fastly` is a wrapper around OpenWhisk actions to that ensures that invocations of the action are only successful if valid Fastly credentials, in the forms of a service ID and token, are provided.

`helix-auth-fastly` can also be used as a simple single-purpose function to validate a pair of Fastly credentials.

To use the `helix-auth-fastly` wrapper set up your OpenWhisk action like this:

```javascript
const { wrap } = require('@adobe/openwhisk-action-utils'};
const { fastlyAuthWrapper } = require('@adobe/helix-auth-fastly'); 

const main = () = {
  // your action code goes here
};

module.exports.main = = wrap(action)
  .with(fastlyAuthWrapper, {token: 'tokenName', service: 'serviceName'});
```

Invocations of your action that do not provide valid credentials will fail with an HTTP status code of `401` (Unauthorized) and your `main` function will never be called.

### Standalone

To use helix-auth-fastly conditionally; you can also execute:
```javascript

const { authFastly } = require('@adobe/helix-auth-fastly');

if(await authFastly(token, service)){
    //authentication has succeeded
} else {
    //authentication has failed
}
```

See the [API documentation](docs/API.md).
